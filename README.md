Top P ranges from 0 to 1 (default), and a lower Top P means the model samples from a narrower selection of words. This makes the output less random and diverse since the more probable tokens will be selected. For instance, if Top P is set at 0.1, only tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

Frequency Penalty helps us avoid using the same words too often. It's like telling the computer, “Hey, don't repeat words too much.”

The OpenAI Presence Penalty setting is used to adjust how much presence of tokens in the source material will influence the output of the model.
